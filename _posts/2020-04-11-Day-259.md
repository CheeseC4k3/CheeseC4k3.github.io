title: OpenSOC CTF “Camp Covid Edition” Write-Up (Day 259)
---

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
__Before you start reading, I just want you to know that it was my first participation in a live CTF and thus my first write up. Hope you like it :)__
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
I did not take notes of the questions themselves, so I will describe them from memory. I did take notes on the answers, which should help me remember the questions.
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
Throughout the CTF there were several different challenges (at least 5). I myself focused on two of them, "Neutrino Cannon" and "APT34".
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
## "Neutrino Cannon" Challenge
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
Scenario: there are several email on the company's network from an employee's account, whose name is Nolan. The Mail is about him selling a Sony disc player.
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
### Questions 1-3
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
First questions were about finding those mails, the specific subject and the attached files. This could all be done with a simple keyword query in Graylog. Using the keyword "Sony" was sufficient for me.
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
### Question 4
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
This question was asking for the specific location of the executable that had been extracted from the attached ZIP file. Searching Graylog for entries containing the attachment, I found out that a lot of logs were created from a workstation called "IT-12".
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
I bet that I would have found the path in Graylog, but I solved this question differently. Knowing that the file was executed, I searched the processes, that run on the workstation with osquery. To sort the processes after time, I imported the CSV in Excel. There I found the path to the executable.
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
This was not the fastest way, but nevertheless gave me the correct answer. The difficulty for me with Graylog was filtering out the relevant information only. The relevant log could be easily overseen if the search parameters allowed too many entries.

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
`C:\Users\Michael.Flores\AppData\Local\Temp\Temp2_sony_md_update.zip\sony_md_update.exe`
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
### Question 5
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
I don't remember the question, and only wrote down "easy" as the solution. lol. Maybe it was the employee's name, "Michael.Flores".
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
### Question 6
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
"On what port does the malicious file communicate?"
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
The solution is port 53, this can be found by displaying the port-parameter in Graylog.
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
### Question 7
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
Solution was "<a href="http://neutrinocannon.net">neutrinocannon.net</a>".

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
### Question 8
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
This question was asking for the md5 hash of the file. Since we know the path, this can be solved nice and clean with osquery as shown below:

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
### Question 9
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
On this question I got stuck and eventually moved to another challenge. Sadly I don't remember the question.
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
## "APT34" Challenge
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
In this challenge we have to deal with a phishing campaign. We are provided with the fact, that the mail is about a "Cambridge Summer Camp" and that the HR department is targeted.
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
### Question 2
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
"What is the subject of the phishing emails?"
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
I searched for several keywords, and found the campaign with this query:
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
### Question 7
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
With the following query we can find out, who downloaded and openend the attachment.
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"sizeSlug":"large"} -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
### Question 8
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
To see what happens after the file is opened, we look at the surrouning logs from the workstation.
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

![Alt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CheeseC4k3/CheeseC4k3.github.io/master/images/opensoc_ctf_2020/11.png "pic11")
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
### Question 10
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
### Question 11
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
"What is the sha256 hash of 1.exe?". This question has become routine:

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
### Question 12+13
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
"What is the suspicious destination hostname the .exe reachhes out to?" We look for external IP addresses our source reaches out to and that have a timestamp that follows our previous logs.
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
![Alt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CheeseC4k3/CheeseC4k3.github.io/master/images/opensoc_ctf_2020/13.png "pic13")
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
### Question 14
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
### Question 15
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
Can't recall the question, here's a sleepy kitten:

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
### Question 16
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
We are provided with an article from Unit42 about the <a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-oilrig-group-steps-attacks-new-delivery-documents-new-injector-trojan/">OilRig campaign and a new injector trojan</a>. The task is to find proof in form of an executable, that the workstation was infected by this attack. The article says, that a part of the attack is the "ISMInjector", an executable named "servicereset" that is stored in the public libraries. A query confirms the expected:

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
### Question 17
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
I think it was another hash question.
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
### Question 18
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
"what is the IMP HASH of servicereset.exe?". On this one I had to use a hint. I knew that since the file was from a real case, the hash would be on the internet somewhere. With the hint I found "<a href="http://virustotal.com">virustotal.com</a>". Entered the MD5 hash I already had, and voila:

### Question 20
<!-- /wp:heading -->

### Question 21
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
Finding another executable - solution "[PATH TO]\wce.exe":
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
### Question 22 + 23
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
I might have already been half asleep at this point. One question was about finding a file that wce.exe writes its output too. I think the file's name was just "output".
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
