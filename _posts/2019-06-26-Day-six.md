title: Messing Around (Day 6)
---

Back again! Five days have passed since my last update. What has happened since:

* On my VM and also my main OS I installed a VPN. Now my network traffic is routed through another server. This allows you to access country restricted sites, for one. It also gives you more anonymity on the web, as it makes it harder for advertisers to connect your behavior to a unique IP address. It feels good to know that Google isn’t watching your every step.

* For even more anonymity I installed TOR, short for The Onion Router. TOR routes your data through several nodes. Each node only knows the node the data came from, so after several turns the server you address isn’t able to tell where the data came from. Don’t know how to put TOR to a use right now, we’ll see…

* I found hackthissite.org and got hooked on the “basic missions”. I found out that I already knew some stuff that comes in handy when looking for website vulnerabilities. Right now I’m on mission 9. I can totally recommend HTS, which requires you to create a very long password though. It is fun and also educative. Has me thinking about password security in general.

* Going on I will stick to HTS for a while, see where it gets me. And think about website security. Have an awesome week!

* PS: If you have a tip on what I should learn about next, don’t hesitate to write it down in the comments.
