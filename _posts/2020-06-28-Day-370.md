title: Getting Certified (Day 372)
---

**I signed up for the CompTIA Network+ exam!**

Everyone can see this huge gap between day 6 and day 259 on my blog, and you might wonder what happened? Have I been inactive or even quit the journey? Fortunately the contrary! I hope that I will find the time to write two or three blog posts in retrospect to fill the gap. 

Anyway, one of my major decision was getting certified. I was amazed when I found out how many certs and courses are available in the field of cyber security and how much practical knowledge you can gain from pursuing them. ***I will write another post on my decision and the plan I laid out ...***

So, Network+ will be my first cert. I have been studying for roughly 3 months now (~10-15 h a week) and will be sitting on the exam in two weeks!

My resources:
- [Wiley Efficient Learning: Network+](https://www.efficientlearning.com/comptia-network-plus/) (Got it heavily reduced in a Humble Bundle, so keep an eye open!)
- [Professor Messer's Free Videos Course Notes](https://www.professormesser.com/)
- [Jason Dion's Practice Exams on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/user/jason-dion/) (Good chance you can grab it for around 10$)
